### C.  Working with SQL.  (30 points)

1.  Create a relational dataset in SQLite or R with [RSQLite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSQLite/RSQLite.pdf) using the `.csv` data found [here](nycflights13/).  Name each table so that it matches the base filenames of the input data.  You can use DB Browser for this, but describe how you did it. If you use SQL commands, include that. If you use R with RSQLite, create a part-c.ipynb and put your codes there.

2.  Replicate 2b above using an SQL query, including both the command and the output.
